# A simple classifier neural network in Scala

A quick weekend project to learn how machine learning actually works inspired by Risto Siilasmaa's excellent blog post [Why you should study AI and Machine Learning and how I did it](https://blog.networks.nokia.com/innovation/2017/11/09/study-ai-machine-learning/).

I also recommend the e-book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen as a great intro to the topic - and it's free!

The network implementation supports arbitrary neuron geometries, though the test bench only uses a trivial case with 2 input and output neurons, and one hidden layer with 2 neurons.
