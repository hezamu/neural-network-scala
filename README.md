# A simple classifier neural network in Scala

A quick weekend project to learn how machine learning actually works. Inspired by the [blog post by Risto Siilasmaa](https://blog.networks.nokia.com/innovation/2017/11/09/study-ai-machine-learning/).

The network implementations supports arbitrary neuron geometries, thought the test bench only uses a trivial case with 2 input and output neurons, and a hidden layer with 2 neurons.
